# COBOL Course

This is my first try to learn the `COBOL` language.
`COBOL` is actually an akronym for Common Business Oriented Language.
`COBOL` is exactly that. A programming language that is used for business.
Almost every bank has parts of its code written in COBOL, making it a 
very strong tool to have on someone's toolkit.

The course I am using is a free one from [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp) on YouTube. 
You can find it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdMAEdGvtLA)

Through the course, to write the code needed, I used VSCode. Some useful extensions for it are:
1. [IBM Z Open Editor](https://ibm.github.io/zopeneditor-about/Docs/introduction.html#key-capabilities): Provides `COBOL`, `PL/I`, `HLASM`, and `REXX` language servers, as well as tools for IBM Z development.
2. [Zowe Explorer](https://github.com/zowe/community#zowe-explorer): VS Code extension, powered by Zowe CLI, that streamlines interaction with mainframe data sets, USS files, and jobs
