# COBOL Course

This is my first try to learn the COBOL language.
COBOL is actually an akronym for Common Business Oriented Language.
COBOL is exactly that. A programming language that is used for business.
Almost every bank has parts of its code written in COBOL, making it a 
very strong tool to have on someone's toolkit.

The course I am using is a free one from [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/@freecodecamp) on YouTube. You can find it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdMAEdGvtLA)
